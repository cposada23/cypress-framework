# Product Requirements Document: Cypress Test Automation Framework

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a robust and scalable test automation framework using **Cypress** and **TypeScript**. The primary goal is to create a unified solution for automated testing that enhances software quality, improves development velocity, and ensures application reliability across various testing stages and environments. This framework will serve as the foundation for all automated testing efforts, including:

- End-to-End (E2E)
- API
- Integration
- Smoke
- Regression testing

---

## 2. Core Objectives

- **Increase Test Coverage:** Automate repetitive and critical test scenarios to broaden the scope of testing.
- **Accelerate Feedback Loops:** Provide developers with rapid feedback on code changes through fast and reliable test execution.
- **Improve Reliability:** Ensure consistent test results and reduce manual testing errors.
- **Enhance Scalability:** Build a framework that can grow with the application, supporting new features and test types.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Multi-Environment Support

The framework must support seamless execution of tests across multiple deployment environments. It should be easy for a developer or QA engineer to target a specific environment with a simple command-line flag.

**Supported Environments:**
- **Local:** For running tests against a developer's local machine.
- **Dev:** To test in the shared development environment.
- **QA:** For formal quality assurance testing cycles.
- **Staging:** For pre-production validation and user acceptance testing (UAT).
- **Production:** For smoke testing and critical path validation on the live environment (to be used with caution).

**Implementation Details:**  
Managed through Cypress configuration files (`cypress.env.json` or custom config files like `cypress.qa.config.ts`), which will store environment-specific variables such as base URLs, API endpoints, and user credentials.

### 3.2. Diverse Testing Capabilities

The framework must be structured to accommodate various types of testing methodologies, allowing for a comprehensive testing strategy from a single codebase.

**Test Types:**
- **E2E Testing:** Simulate real user journeys from start to finish.
- **API Testing:** Directly test API endpoints for functionality, performance, and security using `cy.request()`.
- **Integration Testing:** Verify interactions between different modules or services.
- **Smoke Testing:** A subset of critical-path tests to quickly verify if a build is stable.
- **Regression Testing:** A comprehensive suite of tests to ensure new changes haven't broken existing functionality.

**Implementation Details:**  
Test types will be organized using folder structures and/or tags (e.g., using a preprocessor like `@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor` or custom logic with grep tags) to allow for selective test execution.
